   Remove-Item d:\Miniproj\brand_identity_generator\API_KEYS_FOR_NIMBUS.txt -Force
   ```

2. **Verify environment variables are set in Nimbus**

3. **Test that AI features work** (proves keys are loaded correctly)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If App Won't Start:
1. Check build logs in Nimbus
2. Verify Python version (3.11+)
3. Check if requirements.txt installed correctly
4. Review start command syntax

### If AI Features Don't Work:
1. **Check environment variables:**
   - Go to Nimbus → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Verify all 5 variables are set
   - Check for typos in key names
   - Check for extra spaces in values

2. **Test each API:**
   - Enable AI in sidebar
   - Try Freepik provider
   - Try Stability AI provider
   - Check logs for error messages

3. **Use built-in generators:**
   - Uncheck "Enable AI Generation"
   - Built-in generators work without API keys

### If Text Not Visible:
- Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
- Clear browser cache
- Try different browser
